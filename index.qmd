## About me

As an environmental data scientist, my mission is to harness the power of data to create solutions that balance human well-being with environmental health. By studying the interactions between people and the natural world, I aim to develop clear, impactful visualizations that empower communities to understand challenges, embrace opportunities, and take collective action. I strive to inspire positive change where both people and the planet can thrive together.

## Education

Motivated by a deep interest in environmental conservation, I graduated from the University of Tampa with a B.S. in Environmental Studies and minors in Marine Science and Sustainability. I went on to earn a Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) from UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, where I developed expertise in statistical modeling, programming, and data visualization.

## Professional Experience

I interned for Sarasota County Government in the Parks and Recreational department. In this position, I designed environmental education programs that raised awareness and helped communities reconnect with the natural world. This included children marine science camps, fishing expeditions, beach clean-ups, invasive plant removal, native tree planting, and seagrass and Florida Scrub Jay surveys.

During undergrad, I participated in multiple research projects. I was the lab manager of the Spatial Ecology Lab (SEL), where I conducted research on the diets, spatial distribution, and age and growth patterns of both native and invasive fish species though stomach dissections, external floy tagging, and otolith examination. Partnering with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, I used fishing tournament records to analyze and map the significant changes in King Mackerel populations spatially and over time. Additionally, I was an active member in a public health vaping project, called Vaping On Campus (VOC), where I administered surveys, interviews, and focus groups to study college students’ perceptions of vaping to create effective and targeted vaping cessation programs.

At the University of Tampa, I also served as a teaching assistant for biostatistics, geographic information systems (GIS), and environmental microbiology, which sparked my initial interest in data science and teaching. I mentored students through rigorous software (SPSS and ESRI ArcGIS Pro) and provided instructional support by leading lab and discussion sessions.
