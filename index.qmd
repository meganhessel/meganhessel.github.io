As an environmental data scientist, my mission is to harness the power of data to create solutions that balance human well-being with environmental health. By studying the interactions between people and the natural world, I aim to develop clear, impactful visualizations that empower communities to understand challenges, embrace opportunities, and take collective action. I strive to inspire positive change where both people and the planet can thrive together.

I am a passionate environmentalist. My mission is to balance my strong data science skills with my commitment to solve environmental issues to better the future. As a hardworking and collaborative data scientist, I am eager to develop solutions that better and deepen humansâ€™ relationship with the natural world.
