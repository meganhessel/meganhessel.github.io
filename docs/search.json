    "text": "Professional Experience\nI interned for Sarasota County Government in the Parks and Recreational department. In this position, I designed environmental education programs that raised awareness and helped communities reconnect with the natural world. This included children marine science camps, fishing expeditions, beach clean-ups, invasive plant removal, native tree planting, and seagrass and Florida Scrub Jay surveys.\nDuring undergrad, I participated in multiple research projects. I was the lab manager of the Spatial Ecology Lab (SEL), where I conducted research on the diets, spatial distribution, and age and growth patterns of both native and invasive fish species though stomach dissections, external floy tagging, and otolith examination. Partnering with the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council, I used fishing tournament records to analyze and map the significant changes in King Mackerel populations spatially and over time. Additionally, I was an active member in a public health vaping project, called Vaping On Campus (VOC), where I administered surveys, interviews, and focus groups to study college students’ perceptions of vaping to create effective and targeted vaping cessation programs.\nAt the University of Tampa, I also served as a teaching assistant for biostatistics, geographic information systems (GIS), and environmental microbiology, which sparked my initial interest in data science and teaching. I mentored students through rigorous software (SPSS and ESRI ArcGIS Pro) and provided instructional support by leading lab and discussion sessions."
